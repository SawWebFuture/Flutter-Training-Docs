- Screens everywhere that the language to use to make
- Prebuilt widgets
- Takes from Web-Design
- Widgets are like lego blocks (Floating action Button)

Piece by piece built with code.

Can Deploy to all devices

- lib file (most common)
- pubspec.yaml
- x bring us in the tree of open file
- Editor panel
